---------------------------MY VERY FIRST WEBSITE (16/06/22) ----------------------------------------


This repo contains the code required to make a clone of the BBC news website for the week 2 assessment for CodeNation master course 39

Majority of the code and images are borrowed from : https://github.com/robin3317/BBC-News-Website.git
Alot of code was copied from W3Schools and MDN Website.

However, I have added some of my own features with FlexBox e.g. styling the second menu bar.
There are a couple of improvements I wish to make based on this first draft, these are outlined
below.

[To Improve]
  [1] Use React.js to improve some features
  [2] Implement with JavaScript to add further functionalities to the website.
  [3] Need to add configure the whole body to make sure it can be accessed when browser zoom level is increased
  [4] Add animations wherever necessary, also looking at media queries to be added next week (25/06/2022)
  [5] [X Completed] Use GitHub to host the website (to be done @17/06/2022)
  
  
[Update]: Used Github to host website at : https://mahedjaved.github.io/m39week2/
